# REO-Online-Lisitings-System
What is its rationale?
The primary goal of the system is to connect with the users by providing all necessary up-to-date information of the available property listings. 
The strategic value of this system is that it will be able to identify:
· properties that are available for rent
· properties that can be bought
· properties that are available for sale
· properties that have potential for future developments
· clients who want to buy, sell or rent
· provide periodic evaluation and reports.
